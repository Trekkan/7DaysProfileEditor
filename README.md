This project has been discontinued by me. If anyone wants to take it up, they are free to fork it.

# 7DaysProfileEditor
Tool for editing *.ttp files made for 7 Days To Die

First of all, anyone can contribute to this project! Fork the repository, do what you want and create a pull request. If whatever you did is within reson, I'll add it as is, or with minor modifications to better fit into the project as whole. You can always ask me if you're unsure. =)

If you want to download the tool and you're unsure how, go to https://github.com/Karlovsky120/7DaysProfileEditor/releases/latest and get the latest version there.

As far as licensing goes, you can do everything short of making money from this. I'd also appreciate if you'd link to this repository, should you want to distribute this further in any form, but that's up to you.
